# About

I am a Computer Science student, programmer and robot hobbyist from the UK, interested not just in working with systems, but in understanding how they work. I like working with constraints because they force more efficient solutions to a problem than freedom does. 

I spend most of my time building small projects to explore specific areas or algorithms, with a few larger projects running in the background. Alongside programming, I enjoy mathematical problem-solving, including the British Mathematical Olympiad.

Lately, my interest in low-level systems has taken me to the 6502 computer, where I have been learning to program it in assembly with the end goal of building a simple operating system from scratch. I was inspired by tech from the 70s and 80s like the Commodore and the BBC Micro. The main appeal of this to me is being able to go back to the basics of computing without the bloat of modern software.

I also enjoy game development and pixel art, often in short bursts. Not every project makes it to completion, but most of them earn their value from what they taught me.

On the hardware side, I experiment with robotics. Currently I am working on a robotic arm with six degrees of freedom, which is built around 3D printed parts, some servos, and a Raspberry Pi. You can read more about this in the projects section.
