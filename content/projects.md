# Projects

This is a list of the projects I have completed or am currently working on. For most of them the source code or 3D Models can be found in a repository on my github.

## [Maze Algorithms](#maze.md)

An A Level style Computer Science NEA project that generates, visualises and solves grid based mazes using Depth First Search and A Star algorithms.

## [6 DOF Robot Arm](#robot_arm.md)

A 3D printed robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom and a modular end effector. On the hardware, it uses the Waveshare ST3215 servos, a Raspberry Pi 4B and some custom designed wiring. On the software side it uses ROS2 with MoveIt for Inverse Kinematics with RViz to view the model. Currently ongoing: latest efforts are to increase joint strength by redesigning some parts and then I plan to add machine vision and AI integration with a Hugging Face model.
